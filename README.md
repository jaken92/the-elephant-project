# Installation

Start a php server with localhost from the map where the files are located, currently in the elephant project-folder. Go to localhost/chosenPort/index.php in the webapp and start the game!

# Code Review

Code review written by [Anna Brumark](https://github.com/AnnaBrum).

1. `index.php:147,149,150 etc` - <?php echo could be shortened to <?= to minimize php in html code.
2. `arrays.php:6` - The borders of the players doesn’t seem to display?
3. `functions.php:37` - Nice to refer to Inspo :)
4. Does not display too well on mobile device.
5. Over all, very nice code, easily read and well documented, gold medal!
